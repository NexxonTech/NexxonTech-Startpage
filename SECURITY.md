## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have found a security vulnerability in a supported version, please report it via an email message to [support@nexxontech.it](mailto:support@nexxontech.it).

It will be our priority to verify if the issue is actually present and, in this case, to correct it as soon as possible.

As for what concerns the public bug tracker we ask you to avoid publishing any sensitive information that can lead ill-intentioned people to exploit security vulnerabilities of the application.

Thank you for your help and comprehension.
